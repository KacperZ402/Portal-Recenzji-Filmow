This is only source code of my app

To get this working, you need to initialize express in backend folder with following commands (in console, or terminal)
  npm init -y
  npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors dotenv express-validator

and start it with
  npm start

same in frontend
  npx create-react-app .
  npm install axios react-router-dom react-hook-form yup jwt-decode

and start with
  npm start

Enjoy :)
